## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The history of Serbia covers the historical development of Serbia and of its predecessor states, 
> from the Early Stone Age to the present state, 
> as well as that of the Serbian people and of the areas they ruled historically. 
> 
> Serbian habitation and rule has varied much through the ages, 
> and as a result the history of Serbia is similarly elastic in what it includes.
>
> After early Slavs first appeared in the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries, 
> they mixed with local Byzantine subjects, descendants of Paleo-Balkan tribes, 
> such as the Thracian, Dacian, Roman, Illyrian and former Roman colonists. 
> 
> The First Serbian Principality was established in the 8th century 
> by the Vlastimirovići dynasty ruling over modern-day Montenegro, Bosnia, Dalmatia, and Serbia. 
> 
> It evolved into a Grand Principality by the 11th century, 
> and in 1217 the Kingdom and national church (Serbian Orthodox Church) were established, 
> under the Nemanjić dynasty. 
> 
> In 1345 the Serbian Empire was established, spanning most of the Balkan peninsula. 
> In 1540 Serbia became a part of the Ottoman Empire. 
>
> A significant number of Serbs migrated north to the Kingdom of Hungary, 
> forming what would later become Serbian Vojvodina.  
> 
> Serbian revolution against Ottoman rule in 1817 marked the birth of the Principality of Serbia, 
> which achieved de facto independence in 1867 
> and gained full recognition by the Great Powers in the Berlin Congress of 1878. 
> 
> As a victor in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, 
> Serbia regained Vardar Macedonia, Kosovo and Metohija and Raška. 
> 
> In late 1918, with the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian empire, 
> Serbia was expanded to include regions of the former Serbian Vojvodina.  
> Serbia was united with other Austro-Hungarian provinces 
> into a pan-Slavic State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs; 
> the Kingdom of Serbia joined the union on 1 December 1918 
> and the country was named the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. 
>
> Serbia achieved its current borders at the end of World War II, 
> when it became a federal unit within the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (proclaimed in November 1945). 
> 
> After the dissolution of Yugoslavia in a series of wars in the 1990s, 
> Serbia once again became an independent state on 5 June 2006, 
> following the breakup of a short-lived union with Montenegro.
